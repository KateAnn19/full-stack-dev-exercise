Instructions for Opening:
1. fork and clone
2. npm install
3. npm install axios
4. npm install react-transition-group --save

ðŸ”¥ This was bootstrapped with Create React App. I chose to do this instead of using the script tags for a few different reasons:</br>
1. to break the project into smaller components for readability
2. because I am more familar and comfortable with organizing in this way. 

Exercise 1: </br>
The function and logic is in userCards.js but the component is rendered in App.js. 

Exercise 2: </br>
React Experience: </br>
âœ¨I have less than 1 year experience with React

Exercise 3: </br>
The function and logic is in Head.js and Body.js but the component is rendered in App.js.
