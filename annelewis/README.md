Instructions for Opening:
1. fork and clone
2. npm install
3. npm install axios

ðŸ”¥ This was bootstrapped with Create React App. I chose to do this instead of using the script tags for a few different reasons:</br>
1. to break the project into smaller components for readability
2. because I am more familar and comfortable with organizing in this way. 

React Experience: </br>
